# case-study

1. Imported all necessary libraries 
2. Installed PyDrive and used google autharisation to obtain data from google drive
3. Put data into dataframe
4. Plotted histogram for fetal health
5. Covariance and reshaped variables to fit a regression (fetal movement/fetalhealth)
6. Regression: Coefficient of determination and p-value
7. Train test split and scaler
8. Random Forest with confusion matrix, classification report and accuracy score
9. Repeat the same for KNN and Decision Tree
10. Repeat covariance, reshaping, regression, train test and scaling but for uterine contractions with fetal health
11. Since KNN and Decision Tree had the same results only repeat Random Forest and KNN procedures for uterine contractions with fetal health
