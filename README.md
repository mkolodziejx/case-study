# case-study

# Imported all necessary libraries 
# Installed PyDrive and used google autharisation to obtain data from google drive
# Put data into dataframe
# Plotted histogram for fetal health
# Covariance and reshaped variables to fit a regression (fetal movement/fetalhealth)
# Regression: Coefficient of determination and p-value
# Train test split and scaler
# Random Forest with confusion matrix, classification report and accuracy score
# Repeat the same for KNN and Decision Tree
# Repeat covariance, reshaping, regression, train test and scaling but for uterine contractions with fetal health
# Since KNN and Decision Tree had the same results only repeat Random Forest and KNN procedures for uterine contractions with fetal health
